# Histopathologic-Cancer-Detection
A Kaggle competition, Implemented as an academic project https://www.kaggle.com/c/histopathologic-cancer-detection
The training images here are 1:1 cropped lymphnode tissue samples either containing a tumour or not.
Model is trained to detect and classify the tissue sample as positive or neagtive cancer cells.
Training images are nearly 600k in total having nearly 60:40 distribution of positive and negative samples.
Many more images are generated with the use of ImageDataGenerator to rotate and other ways.
The model is trained/built using CNN
